  "bio": "<strong>Benthos</strong> is an experimental progressive metal band from Milan, Italy. Known for their compelling fusion of progressive metal, mathcore, jazz-rock, and electronic music, Benthos offers a sonic landscape where <strong>complexity</strong> and <strong>curiosity</strong> reign. Their sound is constantly evolving, marked by a deep, refined dynamism and an unwavering pursuit of a unique musical language.<br><br>Formed in 2018, Benthos first captured attention in August 2019 when they opened for <em>The Contortionist</em>, a pillar of modern progressive metal, at Milan's Circolo Svolta. This debut performance instantly gained them recognition in the Italian metal scene.<br><br>Although the bandâ€™s debut album, <em><strong>II</strong></em>, was delayed due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, American label <em>Eclipse Records</em> stood by the group, releasing the album in 2021. The album was highly praised by the international progressive and metal communities, with some hailing it as one of the best debuts in modern prog metal.<br><br>Benthos returned to the stage in 2022 with <em><strong>The Essence Tour</strong></em>, showcasing their hypnotic and schizophrenic live performances across northern Italy, Germany, and Hungary. Their momentum continued into 2023 when they performed on the main stage of Milan's renowed <em><strong>Dissonance Festival</strong></em>, sharing the bill with industry titans like Meshuggah, Soen, and Destrage.<br><br>In June 2024, Benthos completed their second full-length album, <em><strong>From Nothing</strong></em>, which is set to be released on April 25, 2025, via <em>Inside Out Music</em>. Comprising 12 tracks, the album weaves together a tapestry of aggressive, ethereal, chaotic, and jazzy elements, exploring a central theme through multifaceted musical perspectives. The album was mixed by Federico Ascari and mastered by Tony Lindgren at <em>Fascination Street Studios</em>, promising an even more nuanced and dynamic journey for their listeners.<br><br>With their <strong>boundary-pushing</strong> approach, Benthos continues to forge their identity in the progressive and metal landscapes, offering a musical universe that invites fans to dive deep into its ever-evolving sound.",

      "quote": "They are one of the true revelations of the day. The band [...] immediately displays exceptional talent, born from the remarkable skills of the musicians involved and an uncommon taste that seamlessly blends modern progressive metal with a decadent post-rock. They create a succession of rich and emotionally impactful sonic nuances. Benthos manage to destabilize and surprise the audience with rhythm and vocal changes in a highly original emotional crescendo. The unreleased songs they present hint at great things for the band's future in the world of music recording.",
