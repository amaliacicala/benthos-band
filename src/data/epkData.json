      "quote": "They are one of the true revelations of the day. The band [...] immediately displays exceptional talent, born from the remarkable skills of the musicians involved and an uncommon taste that seamlessly blends modern progressive metal with a decadent post-rock. They create a succession of rich and emotionally impactful sonic nuances. Benthos manage to destabilize and surprise the audience with rhythm and vocal changes in a highly original emotional crescendo. The unreleased songs they present hint at great things for the band's future in the world of music recording.",
